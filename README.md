## Introduction

House price prediction is a significant challenge in the real estate market, and machine learning provides powerful tools to tackle this problem. In this project, we leverage the XGBoost algorithm to create a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features of the houses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)]. It contains various features related to houses, such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant characteristics that influence pricing.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we analyze the dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns. This involves:

- Visualizing the distribution of house prices.
- Examining relationships between features and the target variable.
- Identifying potential outliers and missing values.

## Model Building

During model building, we implement the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.
2. Splitting the Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
3. XGBoost Implementation: Training the XGBoost model using the training data.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for improved performance.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. We visualize the predictions against actual values to assess the accuracy of our model.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of XGBoost in predicting house prices. The results highlight the potential of machine learning in the real estate sector and open avenues for further enhancements, such as exploring additional features or using more sophisticated algorithms.
